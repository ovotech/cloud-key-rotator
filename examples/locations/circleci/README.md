# CircleCI Example

## Pre-requisites

In order to rotate a key that's stored in CircleCI env vars, you'll need:

1. A GitHub machine user (**not a human user**)
with write access to the GitHub repository that the CircleCI project is linked to.
2. A CircleCI API key for the GitHub user, which can be generated by logging in
to [circleci.com](circleci.com) as the user, then creating a [personal API token](https://circleci.com/account/api).
3. An env var set on the project in CircleCI.
4. Auth to actually perform the rotation operation with whichever cloud provider
you're using. This will require a service-account or user (with the cloud-provider you're rotating with) that has the required set of permissions. Then, auth will
need to be given to `cloud-key-rotator` (usually in the form of a .json file or
env vars).

## Configuration

```json
  "AccountKeyLocations": [
    {
      "ServiceAccountName": "my_aws_machine_user",
      "CircleCI": [
        {
          "UsernameProject": "my_org/my_repo"
        },
        {
          "UsernameProject": "my_org/my_other_repo"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Credentials": {
    "CircleCIAPIToken": "my_circle_ci_api_token"
  }
```

When rotating AWS keys, there are some optional fields,
`keyIDEnvVar` and `keyEnvVar`, that represent the env var names in CircleCI,
defaulting to values `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
respectively.

So, if you store your Key ID and Key values in env vars in CircleCI that're
named differently, you could set something like this instead:

```json
    "CircleCI": [{
      "UsernameProject": "my_org/my_repo",
      "KeyIDEnvVar": "AWS_KEY_ID",
      "KeyEnvVar": "AWS_KEY"
    }]
```

When rotating GCP keys, to override the default CircleCI env var name (`GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY`), 
you only need to override the `KeyEnvVar` value (as only a single value,
the key, is needed for GCP)

```json
    "CircleCI": [{
      "UsernameProject": "my_org/my_repo",
      "KeyEnvVar": "GCP_KEY"
    }]
```

If you use a GCP key to interact with GCR, especially for downloading
docker images for CircleCI to run your pipelines, then you may want the
key to be stored as JSON directly, rather than base64 encoded (which is
the default). You can do this easily by setting the `Base64Decode` option
to true in the CircleCI location block, like so:

```json
    "CircleCI": [{
      "UsernameProject": "my_org/my_repo",
      "Base64Decode": true
    }]
```
